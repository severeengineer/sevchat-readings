# sevchat-readings

A list of books and other resources put together by certain (s)omeones.

## How to contribute to this list

Checkout a new branch of this repository and modify this file, adding an entry
for the book you want to recommend using the below template:

```
### <title>
**Category**: <category>
**Recommended by**: <your handle>
**Description**:
<description>
```

If the entry needs multiple categories, separate them with commas. You can also
file a PR to add a recommendation to a preexisting entry. Also, make sure to
add your entry in a place that preserves an A-Z title sorting.

## Current categories

* `application-design`
* `graphics`
